It is apparantly not a concious decision to err.
Sometimes we maylearn more from a man's errors then from his virtues.

It is the highest form of self-respect to admit our errors and mis takes and make amends for them To make a mistake is only an error in judgment, but to adhere to it when it is discovered shows infirmity of character.
